- Author: Ohans Emmanuel
- Source: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/bootstrap-4-everything-you-need-to-know-c750991f6784
- Demo: https://danigb.github.io/css-school/bootstrap4/

Things I learn:

- Create small and reusable utility classes
- Mobile first (col col-md)
- Spacing utility classes: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/spacing/
- Every row is a `flex-container` (utility classes: `order`)
- Spash screen: `.fill-viewport { min-height: 100vh; }`
